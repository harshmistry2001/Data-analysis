# Data Analysis – Online Retail

Python analysis of the UCI-style Online Retail transactions dataset to surface revenue trends, customer segments, product performance, and country-level insights. Running the script produces summary tables in the console and exports CSVs for downstream use.

## Repository contents
- `sales_analysis.py` – end-to-end analysis pipeline (data loading, cleaning, analyses, recommendations, CSV export)
- `Online Retail.xlsx` – source dataset expected by the script
- `customer_segmentation.csv`, `product_performance.csv`, `geographic_performance.csv` – example outputs generated by the script

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `openpyxl`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
```

## Usage
1. Ensure `Online Retail.xlsx` is present locally. The script currently points to `C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/resume/Simens/Online Retail.xlsx` inside `load_and_clean_data`; update that path or set `filepath` in `main()` if your copy lives elsewhere.
2. Run the analysis:
```bash
python sales_analysis.py
```
3. Review the console output for trends and recommendations. The script exports:
   - `customer_segmentation.csv`
   - `product_performance.csv`
   - `geographic_performance.csv`

## Analyses performed
- Monthly revenue and growth rates with best/worst months
- Customer segmentation (order count, revenue, AOV) with high/medium/low value groups
- Product performance with Pareto-style concentration check
- Geographic revenue and customer distribution

## Notes
- Visualizations are configured via `matplotlib`/`seaborn`; add plots as needed.
- For automation, parameterize the input path and output directory before deployment.
